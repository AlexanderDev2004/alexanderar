# Error: `libstdc++-6.dll`

Hi, I had an experience while trying to code C++ on Windows using VS Code. I was attempting to compile a "Hello World" program, but encountered an error when executing the following command:

```bash
g++ -g -o hello hello.cpp
```
The error result:

```bash
    Starting build...
cmd /c chcp 65001>nul && C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\g++.exe -fdiagnostics-color=always -g D:\Devoloper\leetcode\hello.cpp -o D:\Devoloper\leetcode\hello.exe
collect2.exe: error: ld returned 116 exit status
```
After consulting with ChatGPT, the solution turned out to be a conflict with libstdc++-6.dll from Laragon! The solution:

```bash
ren C:\laragon\bin\git\mingw64\bin\libstdc++-6.dll libstdc++-6.dll.bak
```

And finally, the program compiled successfully!

Why does Laragon affect this? Because Laragon includes git and mingw, which conflict with MSYS2.

# Introduction.
So I think one of the international languages besides English is Mandarin and every year China is experiencing very rapid development, for example in AI, namely deepseek, which can make a hard blow to America which is very expensive in AI development. 

# Sifficulties 
Chinese in my opinion is the most difficult in the tones / spelling of sounds / pinying (拼音) and also writing such as one of them hanzi (汉字). currently I am still learning Pinyin because it is the basis of Chinese if I get the wrong tone pinying (拼音) it will change everything in the sense of translation.

# pinying (拼音.)
Pinyin (拼音) is the romanization of Chinese characters based on their pronunciation. Pinyin is used to teach Chinese and is also used in dictionaries, textbooks and other educational materials. Pinyin is an important tool for learning Chinese, as it helps learners understand how to pronounce words correctly.
For example as below:    
```pinyin
    我 wǒ
    你 nǐ
    他 tā
    她 tā
```

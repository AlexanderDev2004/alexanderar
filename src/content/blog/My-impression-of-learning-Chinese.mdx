# Introduction.
So I think one of the international languages besides English is Mandarin and every year China is experiencing very rapid development, for example in AI, namely deepseek, which can make a hard blow to America which is very expensive in AI development. 

# Sifficulties 
Chinese in my opinion is the most difficult in the tones / spelling of sounds / pinying (拼音) and also writing such as one of them hanzi (汉字). currently I am still learning Pinyin because it is the basis of Chinese if I get the wrong tone pinying (拼音) it will change everything in the sense of translation.

    它 tā
```
